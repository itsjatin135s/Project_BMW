# Project_BMW

This project contain my knowledge about databases and it's implimentation in real life.
I had develoed a crud application on sqlite.
The projest is basically developed for a user who had a miniral water plant so he can track of his services and products so the consumer can check the and keep trak of his services and owner can add, update, delete and check the current users in his businees but I tried to make it general so any business man can use that just need to alter some database entries soon I will try to make it more usable for wide variety.

I will soon ulpoad the whole code with raw entries ASAP. 

feel free to sugeest changes in the project.
Thank You
